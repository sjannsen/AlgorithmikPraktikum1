# setdefault()
# When the setdefault() method is called for a given key, it checks if the key exists in the dictionary.
# If the key does not exist, the setdefault() method creates the key and sets the default
# value (an empty list in this case) as the value for the key. If the key already exists, the setdefault() method
# returns the current value for the key. In either case, the append() method is used to add elements to the list
# associated with the key.
